NAME
    CGI-Session - persistent session in CGI applications

SYNOPSIS
        # Object initialization:
        use CGI::Session qw/-api3/;

        my $session = new CGI::Session("driver:File", undef, {Directory=>'/tmp'});

        # getting the effective session id:
        my $CGISESSID = $session->id();

        # storing data in the session
        $session->param('f_name', 'Sherzod');
        # or
        $session->param(-name=>'l_name', -value=>'Ruzmetov');

        # retrieving data
        my $f_name = $session->param('f_name');
        # or
        my $l_name = $session->param(-name=>'l_name');

        # clearing a certain session parameter
        $session->clear(["_IS_LOGGED_IN"]);

        # expire '_IS_LOGGED_IN' flag after 10 idle minutes:
        $session->expire(_IS_LOGGED_IN => '+10m')

        # expire the session itself after 1 idle hour
        $session->expire('+1h');

        # delete the session for good
        $session->delete();

DESCRIPTION
    CGI-Session is a Perl5 library that provides an easy, reliable and
    modular session management system across HTTP requests. Persistency is a
    key feature for such applications as shopping carts,
    login/authentication routines, and application that need to carry data
    accross HTTP requests. CGI::Session does that and many more

TO LEARN MORE
    Current manual is optimized to be used as a quick reference. To learn
    more both about the logic behind session management and CGI::Session
    programming style, consider the following:

    *   CGI::Session::Tutorial - extended CGI::Session manual. Also includes
        library architecture and driver specifications.

    *   CGI::Session::CookBook - practical solutions for real life problems

    *   RFC 2965 - "HTTP State Management Mechanism" found at
        ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2965.txt

    *   CGI - standard CGI library

    *   Apache::Session - another fine alternative to CGI::Session

METHODS
    Following is the overview of all the available methods accessible via
    CGI::Session object.

    "new( DSN, SID, HASHREF )"
        Requires three arguments. First is the Data Source Name, second
        should be the session id to be initialized or an object which
        provides either of 'param()' or 'cookie()' mehods. If Data Source
        Name is undef, it will fall back to default values, which are
        "driver:File;serializer:Default;id:MD5".

        If session id is missing, it will force the library to generate a
        new session id, which will be accessible through "id()" method.

        Examples:

            $session = new CGI::Session(undef, undef, {Directory=>'/tmp'});
            $session = new CGI::Session("driver:File;serializer:Storable", undef,  {Directory=>'/tmp'})
            $session = new CGI::Session("driver:MySQL;id:Incr", undef, {Handle=>$dbh});

        Following data source variables are supported:

        *   "driver" - CGI::Session driver. Available drivers are "File",
            "DB_File" and "MySQL". Default is "File".

        *   "serializer" - serializer to be used to encode the data
            structure before saving in the disk. Available serializers are
            "Storable", "FreezeThaw" and "Default". Default is "Default",
            which uses standard Data::Dumper

        *   "id" - ID generator to use when new session is to be created.
            Available ID generators are "MD5" and "Incr". Default is "MD5".

    "id()"
        Returns effective ID for a session. Since effective ID and claimed
        ID can differ, valid session id should always be retrieved using
        this method.

    "param($name)"
    "param(-name=>$name)"
        this method used in either of the above syntax returns a session
        parameter set to "$name" or undef on failure.

    "param( $name, $value)"
    "param(-name=>$name, -value=>$value)"
        method used in either of the above syntax assigns a new value to
        $name parameter, which can later be retrieved with previously
        introduced param() syntax.

    "param_hashref()"
        returns all the session parameters as a reference to a hash

    "save_param($cgi)"
    "save_param($cgi, $arrayref)"
        Saves CGI parameters to session object. In otherwords, it's calling
        "param($name, $value)" for every single CGI parameter. The first
        argument should be either CGI object or any object which can provide
        param() method. If second argument is present and is a reference to
        an array, only those CGI parameters found in the array will be
        stored in the session

    "load_param($cgi)"
    "load_param($cgi, $arrayref)"
        loads session parameters to CGI object. The first argument is
        required to be either CGI.pm object, or any other object which can
        provide param() method. If second argument is present and is a
        reference to an array, only the parameters found in that array will
        be loaded to CGI object.

    "clear()"
    "clear([@list])"
        clears parameters from the session object. If passed an argument as
        an arrayref, clears only those parameters found in the list.

    "flush()"
        synchronizes data in the buffer with its copy in disk. Normally it
        will be called for you just before the program terminates, session
        object goes out of scope or close() is called.

    "close()"
        closes the session temporarily until new() is called on the same
        session next time. In other words, it's a call to flush() and
        DESTROY(), but a lot slower. Normally you never have to call
        close().

    "atime()"
        returns the last access time of the session in the form of seconds
        from epoch. This time is used internally while auto-expiring
        sessions and/or session parameters.

    "ctime()"
        returns the time when the session was first created.

    "expires()"
    "expires($time)"
    "expires($param, $time)"
        Sets expiration date relative to atime(). If used with no arguments,
        returns the expiration date if it was ever set. If no expiration was
        ever set, returns undef.

        Second form sets an expiration time. This value is checked when
        previously stored session is asked to be retrieved, and if its
        expiration date has passed will be expunged from the disk
        immediately and new session is created accordingly. Passing 0 would
        cancel expiration date.

        By using the third syntax you can also set an expiration date for a
        particular session parameter, say "~logged-in". This would cause the
        library call clear() on the parameter when its time is up.

        All the time values should be given in the form of seconds.
        Following time aliases are also supported for your convenience:

            +===========+===============+
            |   alias   |   meaning     |
            +===========+===============+
            |     s     |   Second      |
            |     m     |   Minute      |
            |     h     |   Hour        |
            |     w     |   Week        |
            |     M     |   Month       |
            |     y     |   Year        |
            +-----------+---------------+

        Examples:

            $session->expires("+1y");   # expires in one year
            $session->expires(0);       # cancel expiration
            $session->expires("~logged-in", "+10m");# expires ~logged-in flag in 10 mins

        Note: all the expiration times are relative to session's last access
        time, not to its creation time. To expire a session immediately,
        call "delete()". To expire a specific session parameter immediately,
        call "clear()" on that parameter.

    "remote_addr()"
        returns the remote address of the user who created the session for
        the first time. Returns undef if variable REMOTE_ADDR wasn't present
        in the environment when the session was created

    "delete()"
        deletes the session from the disk. In other words, it calls for
        immediate expiration after which the session will not be accessible

    "error()"
        returns the last error message from the library. It's the same as
        the value of $CGI::Session::errstr. Example:

            $session->flush() or die $session->error();

    "dump()"
    "dump("logs/dump.txt")"
        creates a dump of the session object. Argument, if passed, will be
        interpreted as the name of the file object should be dumped in. Used
        mostly for debugging.
